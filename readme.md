(This can be mocked up without the dev store)

### Objective:

The aim is to see your **thinking & process** along with creating the designs.  
Please create a **Git repository** for the work and add as many **commits** as you think will help showcase your development process.

---

### Once Completed:

Please send through a link to the completed **Git repository**.  
[x] The preview should be as simple as opening the main **HTML file**, or alternatively host the example online for preview.  
[x] There should be **no local build step** required to review the final result.
